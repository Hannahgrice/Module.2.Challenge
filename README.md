In this Module Challenge I was aided by a tutoring session with UTBootcamp tutor- Reshaan Gareeb not to go over my code, but to gain a literal explanation of the challenge. 
I wrote my code through trial and error of code from previous in class work and further tutorials on youtube of basic examples of how to code specific calculations such as volume calc and percentages.
